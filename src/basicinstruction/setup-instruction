2. Redux
Redux has (always) a single store.
Whenever you want to replace the state in the store, you dispatch an action.
The action is caught by one or more reducers.
The reducer/s create a new state that combines the old state, and the dispatched action.
The store subscribers are notified that there is a new state.

3.
redux: main library (independent from React)
redux-thunk: a redux middleware which helps you with async actions
react-redux: connects your redux store with ReactComponents
